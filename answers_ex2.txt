## Q1

Y_i = α + τ*W_i + β*X_i + ε_i fitted

Where:
- Y  = stakeholder engagement score
- W  = treatment indicator (1 if participated, 0 otherwise)
- X  = annual sustainability spending (in $1,000s)
- α (alpha)  = intercept
- τ (tau)    = causal effect of treatment (ATE)
- β (beta)   = effect of spending

a) Parameters estimated using linear regression: α̂ = 95.97, τ̂ = –9.11, β̂ = 1.51 (Using Python)
b) Estimated ATE (τ̂) = -9.1057, p‑value = 0.0004 (p < 0.05, statistically significant), indicating participation in the carbon‑offset program W is associated with a statistically highly significant 9.11 point decrease in stakeholder engagement Y (holding spending X fixed).
c) For τ̂  to be causal: conditional on X, W is independent of outcomes (no hidden confounders). Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) holds (no interference and a well defined treatment). For each value of X, there must be overlap of both W=1 and W=0. The linear regression model is appropriate and no key predictors are left out.

## Q2

c) When run my API using input values W_i = 1 (participated in the carbon offset program) and X_i = 20 (corporation annualy spent $20,000 on sustainability initiatives), the predicted engagement score returned is 117.16.
